------- Instructions:

Extract the "Custom Ammunation" folder into the ModLoader folder.
DELETE OLD VERSION SCRIPT BEFORE INSTALLING THIS NEW ONE!

The "Weapon Names" folder is optional, for a simpler way to define the weapons names in the configuration file. Other mods can also use it.
If you already have it into your game, you may want to not replace it.

== How to use:

If you install the mod, you won't notice anything different.

- For a quick test, you can grab some "ammun.dat" file in the "(settings)" folder and replace it in the mod folder. You need the folder "Weapon Names" in ModLoader.
  "(settings)\Heavy Weapons" will add RPG, Heatseek, Flamethrower and Minigun in the "Heavy" category. But only after "Black Project" mission.

To configure, open the file "Custom Ammunation\data\ammun.dat" with some text editor. It looks better in Notepad++.
At the end of file you define the weapon list, being the weapon ID, followed by the name of the GXT entry (from .fxt), animation, category, unlock mission, price, ammo and which stores are available.
For example, the Minigun is ID "38", and is for the category "Heavy" (8). A weapon added without replacing normally goes for ID "70".

If you have the folder "Weapon Names" installed, in the weapon name, you can use for example "WEAP38" for the name of the Minigun (which is ID 38).
That is, if you open "WeaponNames.fxt" with a text editor, you have the name of all weapons with their ID, and you can also add more weapon names there (ID 70, 71 etc).



Version: v3.5 + WeaponNames.fxt
